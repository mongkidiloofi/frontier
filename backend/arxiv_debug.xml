    <title>CODA: Coordinating the Cerebrum and Cerebellum for a Dual-Brain Computer
  Use Agent with Decoupled Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) face significant
challenges in specialized domains such as scientific computing, where both
long-horizon planning and precise execution are required. Existing approaches
suffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorly
in execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness.
Recent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining a
planner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, which
prevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given the
scarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these
limitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework
that integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor
(Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage,
Specialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner
for each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of
task trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all
successful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated
dataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner.
This equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization.
Evaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark,
CODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art
among open-source models.

    <title>Discrete-Guided Diffusion for Scalable and Safe Multi-Robot Motion
  Planning</title>
    <summary>  Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) involves generating collision-free
trajectories for multiple robots operating in a shared continuous workspace.
While discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted due
to their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectory
quality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer
higher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in
poor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the
limitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that
integrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models.
The resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key
characteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into
tractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines
discrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide
diffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and
(3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure
trajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art
performance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while
achieving planning efficiency and high success rates.

    <title>Bridging Domain Gaps for Fine-Grained Moth Classification Through
  Expert-Informed Adaptation and Foundation Model Priors</title>
    <summary>  Labelling images of Lepidoptera (moths) from automated camera systems is
vital for understanding insect declines. However, accurate species
identification is challenging due to domain shifts between curated images and
noisy field imagery. We propose a lightweight classification approach,
combining limited expert-labelled field data with knowledge distillation from
the high-performance BioCLIP2 foundation model into a ConvNeXt-tiny
architecture. Experiments on 101 Danish moth species from AMI camera systems
demonstrate that BioCLIP2 substantially outperforms other methods and that our
distilled lightweight model achieves comparable accuracy with significantly
reduced computational cost. These insights offer practical guidelines for the
development of efficient insect monitoring systems and bridging domain gaps for
fine-grained classification.

    <title>AudioStory: Generating Long-Form Narrative Audio with Large Language
  Models</title>
    <summary>  Recent advances in text-to-audio (TTA) generation excel at synthesizing short
audio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio, which requires
temporal coherence and compositional reasoning. To address this gap, we propose
AudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs)
with TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory
possesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It
employs LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered
sub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and
emotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1)
Decoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser
collaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for
intra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence
preservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension
and audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory
eliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy
between components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K,
encompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound
narratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both
single-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA
baselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity. Our code is
available at https://github.com/TencentARC/AudioStory

    <title>HERMES: Human-to-Robot Embodied Learning from Multi-Source Motion Data
  for Mobile Dexterous Manipulation</title>
    <summary>  Leveraging human motion data to impart robots with versatile manipulation
skills has emerged as a promising paradigm in robotic manipulation.
Nevertheless, translating multi-source human hand motions into feasible robot
behaviors remains challenging, particularly for robots equipped with
multi-fingered dexterous hands characterized by complex, high-dimensional
action spaces. Moreover, existing approaches often struggle to produce policies
capable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we
introduce HERMES, a human-to-robot learning framework for mobile bimanual
dexterous manipulation. First, HERMES formulates a unified reinforcement
learning approach capable of seamlessly transforming heterogeneous human hand
motions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors.
Subsequently, to mitigate the sim2real gap, we devise an end-to-end, depth
image-based sim2real transfer method for improved generalization to real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, to enable autonomous operation in varied and
unstructured environments, we augment the navigation foundation model with a
closed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization mechanism, ensuring precise
alignment of visual goals and effectively bridging autonomous navigation and
dexterous manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HERMES
consistently exhibits generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild
scenarios, successfully performing numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous
manipulation tasks. Project Page:https:/gemcollector.github.io/HERMES/.

    <title>Disabling Self-Correction in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Stealthy
  Retriever Poisoning</title>
    <summary>  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a standard approach for
improving the reliability of large language models (LLMs). Prior work
demonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems by misleading them into
generating attacker-chosen outputs through poisoning the knowledge base.
However, this paper uncovers that such attacks could be mitigated by the strong
\textit{self-correction ability (SCA)} of modern LLMs, which can reject false
context once properly configured. This SCA poses a significant challenge for
attackers aiming to manipulate RAG systems.
  In contrast to previous poisoning methods, which primarily target the
knowledge base, we introduce \textsc{DisarmRAG}, a new poisoning paradigm that
compromises the retriever itself to suppress the SCA and enforce
attacker-chosen outputs. This compromisation enables the attacker to
straightforwardly embed anti-SCA instructions into the context provided to the
generator, thereby bypassing the SCA. To this end, we present a
contrastive-learning-based model editing technique that performs localized and
stealthy edits, ensuring the retriever returns a malicious instruction only for
specific victim queries while preserving benign retrieval behavior. To further
strengthen the attack, we design an iterative co-optimization framework that
automatically discovers robust instructions capable of bypassing prompt-based
defenses. We extensively evaluate DisarmRAG across six LLMs and three QA
benchmarks. Our results show near-perfect retrieval of malicious instructions,
which successfully suppress SCA and achieve attack success rates exceeding 90\%
under diverse defensive prompts. Also, the edited retriever remains stealthy
under several detection methods, highlighting the urgent need for
retriever-centric defenses.

    <title>Seam360GS: Seamless 360Â° Gaussian Splatting from Real-World
  Omnidirectional Images</title>
    <summary>  360-degree visual content is widely shared on platforms such as YouTube and
plays a central role in virtual reality, robotics, and autonomous navigation.
However, consumer-grade dual-fisheye systems consistently yield imperfect
panoramas due to inherent lens separation and angular distortions. In this
work, we introduce a novel calibration framework that incorporates a
dual-fisheye camera model into the 3D Gaussian splatting pipeline. Our approach
not only simulates the realistic visual artifacts produced by dual-fisheye
cameras but also enables the synthesis of seamlessly rendered 360-degree
images. By jointly optimizing 3D Gaussian parameters alongside calibration
variables that emulate lens gaps and angular distortions, our framework
transforms imperfect omnidirectional inputs into flawless novel view synthesis.
Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that our method produces
seamless renderings-even from imperfect images-and outperforms existing
360-degree rendering models.

    <title>Anomaly Detection in Networked Bandits</title>
    <summary>  The nodes' interconnections on a social network often reflect their
dependencies and information-sharing behaviors. Nevertheless, abnormal nodes,
which significantly deviate from most of the network concerning patterns or
behaviors, can lead to grave consequences. Therefore, it is imperative to
design efficient online learning algorithms that robustly learn users'
preferences while simultaneously detecting anomalies.
  We introduce a novel bandit algorithm to address this problem. Through
network knowledge, the method characterizes the users' preferences and
residuals of feature information. By learning and analyzing these preferences
and residuals, it develops a personalized recommendation strategy for each user
and simultaneously detects anomalies. We rigorously prove an upper bound on the
regret of the proposed algorithm and experimentally compare it with several
state-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

    <title>Discrete Diffusion VLA: Bringing Discrete Diffusion to Action Decoding
  in Vision-Language-Action Policies</title>
    <summary>  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to
map images and instructions to robot actions. However, prevailing VLA decoders
either generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or
attach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone,
demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified,
scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformer
policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is
trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design
retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively
compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an
adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones
and uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement
rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This
unified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel
decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of
function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO,
71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv
Bridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines.
These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action decoder supports precise
action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to
larger models and datasets.

    <title>A Partially Derivative-Free Proximal Method for Composite Multiobjective
  Optimization in the HÃ¶lder Setting</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents an algorithm for solving multiobjective optimization
problems involving composite functions, where we minimize a quadratic model
that approximates $F(x) - F(x^k)$ and that can be derivative-free. We establish
theoretical assumptions about the component functions of the composition and
provide comprehensive convergence and complexity analysis. Specifically, we
prove that the proposed method converges to a weakly $\varepsilon$-approximate
Pareto point in at most
$\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{\beta+1}{\beta}}\right)$ iterations,
where $\beta$ denotes the H\"{o}lder exponent of the gradient. The algorithm
incorporates gradient approximations and a scaling matrix $B_k$ to achieve an
optimal balance between computational accuracy and efficiency. Numerical
experiments on robust biobjective instances with Lipschitz and
H\"{o}lder-gradient components illustrate the method's behavior. In these
tests, the proposed approach was able to approximate the Pareto front under
different levels of uncertainty and consistently recovered distinct solutions,
even in challenging cases where the objectives have only H\"{o}lder continuous
gradients.

    <title>11Plus-Bench: Demystifying Multimodal LLM Spatial Reasoning with
  Cognitive-Inspired Analysis</title>
    <summary>  For human cognitive process, spatial reasoning and perception are closely
entangled, yet the nature of this interplay remains underexplored in the
evaluation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent MLLM
advancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity for
human-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, we
introduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning
abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central to
our work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic
standardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained
expert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process,
enabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive
experiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs
exhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap
compared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that
cognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity.
However, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas
human correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern
complexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations
in current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable
insights for advancing model design.

    <title>Neural Conditional Simulation for Complex Spatial Processes</title>
    <summary>  A key objective in spatial statistics is to simulate from the distribution of
a spatial process at a selection of unobserved locations conditional on
observations (i.e., a predictive distribution) to enable spatial prediction and
uncertainty quantification. However, exact conditional simulation from this
predictive distribution is intractable or inefficient for many spatial process
models. In this paper, we propose neural conditional simulation (NCS), a
general method for spatial conditional simulation that is based on neural
diffusion models. Specifically, using spatial masks, we implement a conditional
score-based diffusion model that evolves Gaussian noise into samples from a
predictive distribution when given a partially observed spatial field and
spatial process parameters as inputs. The diffusion model relies on a neural
network that only requires unconditional samples from the spatial process for
training. Once trained, the diffusion model is amortized with respect to the
observations in the partially observed field, the number and locations of those
observations, and the spatial process parameters, and can therefore be used to
conditionally simulate from a broad class of predictive distributions without
retraining the neural network. We assess the NCS-generated simulations against
simulations from the true conditional distribution of a Gaussian process model,
and against Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations from a Brown--Resnick
process model for spatial extremes. In the latter case, we show that it is more
efficient and accurate to conditionally simulate using NCS than classical MCMC
techniques implemented in standard software. We conclude that NCS enables
efficient and accurate conditional simulation from spatial predictive
distributions that are challenging to sample from using traditional methods.

    <title>PAUL: Uncertainty-Guided Partition and Augmentation for Robust
  Cross-View Geo-Localization under Noisy Correspondence</title>
    <summary>  Cross-view geo-localization is a critical task for UAV navigation, event
detection, and aerial surveying, as it enables matching between drone-captured
and satellite imagery. Most existing approaches embed multi-modal data into a
joint feature space to maximize the similarity of paired images. However, these
methods typically assume perfect alignment of image pairs during training,
which rarely holds true in real-world scenarios. In practice, factors such as
urban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weather
frequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts where
only partial correspondences exist between pairs. Despite its prevalence, this
source of noisy correspondence has received limited attention in current
research. In this paper, we formally introduce and address the Noisy
Correspondence on Cross-View Geo-Localization (NC-CVGL) problem, aiming to
bridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications. To this
end, we propose PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning), a
novel framework that partitions and augments training data based on estimated
data uncertainty through uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential
co-training. Specifically, PAUL selectively augments regions with high
correspondence confidence and utilizes uncertainty estimation to refine feature
learning, effectively suppressing noise from misaligned pairs. Distinct from
traditional filtering or label correction, PAUL leverages both data uncertainty
and loss discrepancy for targeted partitioning and augmentation, thus providing
robust supervision for noisy samples. Comprehensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of individual components in PAUL,which consistently achieves
superior performance over other competitive noisy-correspondence-driven methods
in various noise ratios.

    <title>Patch Progression Masked Autoencoder with Fusion CNN Network for
  Classifying Evolution Between Two Pairs of 2D OCT Slices</title>
    <summary>  Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent eye condition affecting
visual acuity. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatments
have been effective in slowing the progression of neovascular AMD, with better
outcomes achieved through timely diagnosis and consistent monitoring. Tracking
the progression of neovascular activity in OCT scans of patients with exudative
AMD allows for the development of more personalized and effective treatment
plans. This was the focus of the Monitoring Age-related Macular Degeneration
Progression in Optical Coherence Tomography (MARIO) challenge, in which we
participated. In Task 1, which involved classifying the evolution between two
pairs of 2D slices from consecutive OCT acquisitions, we employed a fusion CNN
network with model ensembling to further enhance the model's performance. For
Task 2, which focused on predicting progression over the next three months
based on current exam data, we proposed the Patch Progression Masked
Autoencoder that generates an OCT for the next exam and then classifies the
evolution between the current OCT and the one generated using our solution from
Task 1. The results we achieved allowed us to place in the Top 10 for both
tasks. Some team members are part of the same organization as the challenge
organizers; therefore, we are not eligible to compete for the prize.

    <title>OpenM3D: Open Vocabulary Multi-view Indoor 3D Object Detection without
  Human Annotations</title>
    <summary>  Open-vocabulary (OV) 3D object detection is an emerging field, yet its
exploration through image-based methods remains limited compared to 3D point
cloud-based methods. We introduce OpenM3D, a novel open-vocabulary multi-view
indoor 3D object detector trained without human annotations. In particular,
OpenM3D is a single-stage detector adapting the 2D-induced voxel features from
the ImGeoNet model. To support OV, it is jointly trained with a class-agnostic
3D localization loss requiring high-quality 3D pseudo boxes and a
voxel-semantic alignment loss requiring diverse pre-trained CLIP features. We
follow the training setting of OV-3DET where posed RGB-D images are given but
no human annotations of 3D boxes or classes are available. We propose a 3D
Pseudo Box Generation method using a graph embedding technique that combines 2D
segments into coherent 3D structures. Our pseudo-boxes achieve higher precision
and recall than other methods, including the method proposed in OV-3DET. We
further sample diverse CLIP features from 2D segments associated with each
coherent 3D structure to align with the corresponding voxel feature. The key to
training a highly accurate single-stage detector requires both losses to be
learned toward high-quality targets. At inference, OpenM3D, a highly efficient
detector, requires only multi-view images for input and demonstrates superior
accuracy and speed (0.3 sec. per scene) on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes indoor
benchmarks compared to existing methods. We outperform a strong two-stage
method that leverages our class-agnostic detector with a ViT CLIP-based OV
classifier and a baseline incorporating multi-view depth estimator on both
accuracy and speed.

    <title>Moment Constrained Optimal Transport for Thermostatically Controlled
  Loads</title>
    <summary>  Controlling large populations of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs),
such as water heaters, poses significant challenges due to the need to balance
global constraints (e.g., grid stability) with individual requirements (e.g.,
physical limits and quality of service). In this work, we introduce a novel
framework based on Moment Constrained Optimal Transport (MCOT) for distributed
control of TCLs. By formulating the control problem as an optimal transport
problem with moment constraints, our approach integrates global consumption
constraints and physical feasibility conditions into the control design. This
problem with high (or infinite) dimensionality can be reduced to a much lower
finite-dimensional problem. The structure of this problem allows for computing
the gradient with Monte Carlo methods by generating trajectories of TCLs.
Contrary to all previous work, in our MCOT framework, it is possible to choose
the sampling law, which considerably speeds up the calculations. This algorithm
mitigates the need for extensive state-space discretization and significantly
reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods. Numerical
experiments in a water heater case study demonstrate that our MCOT-based method
effectively coordinates TCLs under various constraints. We further extend our
approach to an online setting, illustrating its practical applicability on
simulated data from the SMACH (Multi-agent Simulation of Human Activity in the
Household) platform.

    <title>Reinforcement Learning for Search Tree Size Minimization in Constraint
  Programming: New Results on Scheduling Benchmarks</title>
    <summary>  Failure-Directed Search (FDS) is a significant complete generic search
algorithm used in Constraint Programming (CP) to efficiently explore the search
space, proven particularly effective on scheduling problems. This paper
analyzes FDS's properties, showing that minimizing the size of its search tree
guided by ranked branching decisions is closely related to the Multi-armed
bandit (MAB) problem. Building on this insight, MAB reinforcement learning
algorithms are applied to FDS, extended with problem-specific refinements and
parameter tuning, and evaluated on the two most fundamental scheduling
problems, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and Resource-Constrained
Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The resulting enhanced FDS, using the best
extended MAB algorithm and configuration, performs 1.7 times faster on the JSSP
and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks compared to the original
implementation in a new solver called OptalCP, while also being 3.5 times
faster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks than the
current state-of-the-art FDS algorithm in IBM CP Optimizer 22.1. Furthermore,
using only a 900-second time limit per instance, the enhanced FDS improved the
existing state-of-the-art lower bounds of 78 of 84 JSSP and 226 of 393 RCPSP
standard open benchmark instances while also completely closing a few of them.

    <title>AraHealthQA 2025 Shared Task Description Paper</title>
    <summary>  We introduce {AraHealthQA 2025}, the {Comprehensive Arabic Health Question
Answering Shared Task}, held in conjunction with {ArabicNLP 2025} (co-located
with EMNLP 2025). This shared task addresses the paucity of high-quality Arabic
medical QA resources by offering two complementary tracks: {MentalQA}, focusing
on Arabic mental health Q\&amp;A (e.g., anxiety, depression, stigma reduction), and
{MedArabiQ}, covering broader medical domains such as internal medicine,
pediatrics, and clinical decision making. Each track comprises multiple
subtasks, evaluation datasets, and standardized metrics, facilitating fair
benchmarking. The task was structured to promote modeling under realistic,
multilingual, and culturally nuanced healthcare contexts. We outline the
dataset creation, task design and evaluation framework, participation
statistics, baseline systems, and summarize the overall outcomes. We conclude
with reflections on the performance trends observed and prospects for future
iterations in Arabic health QA.

    <title>Nagumo-Type Characterization of Forward Invariance for Constrained
  Systems</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a Nagumo-type invariance condition for differential
inclusions defined on closed constraint sets. More specifically, given a closed
set to render forward invariant, the proposed condition restricts the system's
dynamics, assumed to be locally Lipschitz, on the boundary of the set
restricted to the interior of the constraint set. In particular, when the
boundary of the set is entirely within the interior of the constraint set, the
proposed condition reduces to the well-known Nagumo condition, known to be
necessary and sufficient for forward invariance in this case. This being said,
the proposed condition is only necessary in the general setting. As a result,
we provide a set of additional assumptions relating the constrained system to
the set to render forward invariant, and restricting to the geometry at the
intersection between the two sets, so that the equivalence holds. The
importance of the proposed assumptions is illustrated via examples.

    <title>Model Science: getting serious about verification, explanation and
  control of AI systems</title>
    <summary>  The growing adoption of foundation models calls for a paradigm shift from
Data Science to Model Science. Unlike data-centric approaches, Model Science
places the trained model at the core of analysis, aiming to interact, verify,
explain, and control its behavior across diverse operational contexts. This
paper introduces a conceptual framework for a new discipline called Model
Science, along with the proposal for its four key pillars: Verification, which
requires strict, context-aware evaluation protocols; Explanation, which is
understood as various approaches to explore of internal model operations;
Control, which integrates alignment techniques to steer model behavior; and
Interface, which develops interactive and visual explanation tools to improve
human calibration and decision-making. The proposed framework aims to guide the
development of credible, safe, and human-aligned AI systems.

    <title>Robust Paths: Geometry and Computation</title>
    <summary>  Applying robust optimization often requires selecting an appropriate
uncertainty set both in shape and size, a choice that directly affects the
trade-off between average-case and worst-case performances. In practice, this
calibration is usually done via trial-and-error: solving the robust
optimization problem many times with different uncertainty set shapes and
sizes, and examining their performance trade-off. This process is
computationally expensive and ad hoc. In this work, we take a principled
approach to study this issue for robust optimization problems with linear
objective functions, convex feasible regions, and convex uncertainty sets. We
introduce and study what we define as the robust path: a set of robust
solutions obtained by varying the uncertainty set's parameters. Our central
geometric insight is that a robust path can be characterized as a Bregman
projection of a curve (whose geometry is defined by the uncertainty set) onto
the feasible region. This leads to a surprising discovery that the robust path
can be approximated via the trajectories of standard optimization algorithms,
such as the proximal point method, of the deterministic counterpart problem. We
give a sharp approximation error bound and show it depends on the geometry of
the feasible region and the uncertainty set. We also illustrate two special
cases where the approximation error is zero: the feasible region is
polyhedrally monotone (e.g., a simplex feasible region under an ellipsoidal
uncertainty set), or the feasible region and the uncertainty set follow a dual
relationship. We demonstrate the practical impact of this approach in two
settings: portfolio optimization and adversarial deep learning.

    <title>Forewarned is Forearmed: Pre-Synthesizing Jailbreak-like Instructions to
  Enhance LLM Safety Guardrail to Potential Attacks</title>
    <summary>  Despite advances in improving large language model(LLM) to refuse to answer
malicious instructions, widely used LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks
where attackers generate instructions with distributions differing from safety
alignment corpora. New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen
malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between
training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive
patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis
framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate
jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional
gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE
follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text
generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of
safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on
the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates
significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2
without compromising their utility.

    <title>Visio-Verbal Teleimpedance Interface: Enabling Semi-Autonomous Control
  of Physical Interaction via Eye Tracking and Speech</title>
    <summary>  The paper presents a visio-verbal teleimpedance interface for commanding 3D
stiffness ellipsoids to the remote robot with a combination of the operator's
gaze and verbal interaction. The gaze is detected by an eye-tracker, allowing
the system to understand the context in terms of what the operator is currently
looking at in the scene. Along with verbal interaction, a Visual Language Model
(VLM) processes this information, enabling the operator to communicate their
intended action or provide corrections. Based on these inputs, the interface
can then generate appropriate stiffness matrices for different physical
interaction actions. To validate the proposed visio-verbal teleimpedance
interface, we conducted a series of experiments on a setup including a Force
Dimension Sigma.7 haptic device to control the motion of the remote Kuka LBR
iiwa robotic arm. The human operator's gaze is tracked by Tobii Pro Glasses 2,
while human verbal commands are processed by a VLM using GPT-4o. The first
experiment explored the optimal prompt configuration for the interface. The
second and third experiments demonstrated different functionalities of the
interface on a slide-in-the-groove task.

    <title>Eigenvalue distribution of the Neural Tangent Kernel in the quadratic
  scaling</title>
    <summary>  We compute the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of the neural tangent
kernel of a two-layer neural network under a specific scaling of dimension.
Namely, if $X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ is an i.i.d random matrix,
$W\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times p}$ is an i.i.d $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ matrix and
$D\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ is a diagonal matrix with i.i.d bounded entries,
we consider the matrix
  \[
  \mathrm{NTK}
  =
  \frac{1}{d}XX^\top
  \odot
  \frac{1}{p}
  \sigma'\left(
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}XW
  \right)D^2
  \sigma'\left(
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}XW
  \right)^\top
  \]
  where $\sigma'$ is a pseudo-Lipschitz function applied entrywise and under
the scaling $\frac{n}{dp}\to \gamma_1$ and $\frac{p}{d}\to \gamma_2$. We
describe the asymptotic distribution as the free multiplicative convolution of
the Marchenko--Pastur distribution with a deterministic distribution depending
on $\sigma$ and $D$.

    <title>DeepScholar-Bench: A Live Benchmark and Automated Evaluation for
  Generative Research Synthesis</title>
    <summary>  The ability to research and synthesize knowledge is central to human
expertise and progress. An emerging class of systems promises these exciting
capabilities through generative research synthesis, performing retrieval over
the live web and synthesizing discovered sources into long-form, cited
summaries. However, evaluating such systems remains an open challenge: existing
question-answering benchmarks focus on short-form factual responses, while
expert-curated datasets risk staleness and data contamination. Both fail to
capture the complexity and evolving nature of real research synthesis tasks. In
this work, we introduce DeepScholar-bench, a live benchmark and holistic,
automated evaluation framework designed to evaluate generative research
synthesis. DeepScholar-bench draws queries from recent, high-quality ArXiv
papers and focuses on a real research synthesis task: generating the related
work sections of a paper by retrieving, synthesizing, and citing prior
research. Our evaluation framework holistically assesses performance across
three key dimensions, knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and
verifiability. We also develop DeepScholar-base, a reference pipeline
implemented efficiently using the LOTUS API. Using the DeepScholar-bench
framework, we perform a systematic evaluation of prior open-source systems,
search AI's, OpenAI's DeepResearch, and DeepScholar-base. We find that
DeepScholar-base establishes a strong baseline, attaining competitive or higher
performance than each other method. We also find that DeepScholar-bench remains
far from saturated, with no system exceeding a score of $19\%$ across all
metrics. These results underscore the difficulty of DeepScholar-bench, as well
as its importance for progress towards AI systems capable of generative
research synthesis. We make our code available at
https://github.com/guestrin-lab/deepscholar-bench.

    <title>Pruning Strategies for Backdoor Defense in LLMs</title>
    <summary>  Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to the performance and integrity of
pre-trained language models. Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for
downstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor
attacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend
because end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks
consist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or
stylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in
the model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore
whether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge
of the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and
implement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)
layer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2
sparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)
reinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.
Each method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring
validation accuracy to avoid over-pruning. Experimental evaluation shows that
gradient-based pruning performs best while defending the syntactic triggers,
whereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic
attacks.

    <title>Large Language Models (LLMs) for Electronic Design Automation (EDA)</title>
    <summary>  With the growing complexity of modern integrated circuits, hardware engineers
are required to devote more effort to the full design-to-manufacturing
workflow. This workflow involves numerous iterations, making it both
labor-intensive and error-prone. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for more
efficient Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solutions to accelerate hardware
development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable
advancements in contextual comprehension, logical reasoning, and generative
capabilities. Since hardware designs and intermediate scripts can be
represented as text, integrating LLM for EDA offers a promising opportunity to
simplify and even automate the entire workflow. Accordingly, this paper
provides a comprehensive overview of incorporating LLMs into EDA, with emphasis
on their capabilities, limitations, and future opportunities. Three case
studies, along with their outlook, are introduced to demonstrate the
capabilities of LLMs in hardware design, testing, and optimization. Finally,
future directions and challenges are highlighted to further explore the
potential of LLMs in shaping the next-generation EDA, providing valuable
insights for researchers interested in leveraging advanced AI technologies for
EDA.

    <title>Segmentation Assisted Incremental Test Time Adaptation in an Open World</title>
    <summary>  In dynamic environments, unfamiliar objects and distribution shifts are often
encountered, which challenge the generalization abilities of the deployed
trained models. This work addresses Incremental Test Time Adaptation of Vision
Language Models, tackling scenarios where unseen classes and unseen domains
continuously appear during testing. Unlike traditional Test Time Adaptation
approaches, where the test stream comes only from a predefined set of classes,
our framework allows models to adapt simultaneously to both covariate and label
shifts, actively incorporating new classes as they emerge. Towards this goal,
we establish a new benchmark for ITTA, integrating single image TTA methods for
VLMs with active labeling techniques that query an oracle for samples
potentially representing unseen classes during test time. We propose a
segmentation assisted active labeling module, termed SegAssist, which is
training free and repurposes the segmentation capabilities of VLMs to refine
active sample selection, prioritizing samples likely to belong to unseen
classes. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the
potential of SegAssist to enhance the performance of VLMs in real world
scenarios, where continuous adaptation to emerging data is essential.

    <title>Using item recommendations and LLMs in marketing email titles</title>
    <summary>  E-commerce marketplaces make use of a number of marketing channels like
emails, push notifications, etc. to reach their users and stimulate purchases.
Personalized emails especially are a popular touch point for marketers to
inform users of latest items in stock, especially for those who stopped
visiting the marketplace. Such emails contain personalized recommendations
tailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A
common limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of
the email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest
in the contents. In this work, we explore the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for generating thematic titles that reflect the personalized
content of the emails. We perform offline simulations and conduct online
experiments on the order of millions of users, finding our techniques useful in
improving the engagement between customers and our emails. We highlight key
findings and learnings as we productionize the safe and automated generation of
email titles for millions of users.

    <title>FairLoop: Software Support for Human-Centric Fairness in Predictive
  Business Process Monitoring</title>
    <summary>  Sensitive attributes like gender or age can lead to unfair predictions in
machine learning tasks such as predictive business process monitoring,
particularly when used without considering context. We present FairLoop1, a
tool for human-guided bias mitigation in neural network-based prediction
models. FairLoop distills decision trees from neural networks, allowing users
to inspect and modify unfair decision logic, which is then used to fine-tune
the original model towards fairer predictions. Compared to other approaches to
fairness, FairLoop enables context-aware bias removal through human
involvement, addressing the influence of sensitive attributes selectively
rather than excluding them uniformly.

    <title>GS: Generative Segmentation via Label Diffusion</title>
    <summary>  Language-driven image segmentation is a fundamental task in vision-language
understanding, requiring models to segment regions of an image corresponding to
natural language expressions. Traditional methods approach this as a
discriminative problem, assigning each pixel to foreground or background based
on semantic alignment. Recently, diffusion models have been introduced to this
domain, but existing approaches remain image-centric: they either (i) use image
diffusion models as visual feature extractors, (ii) synthesize segmentation
data via image generation to train discriminative models, or (iii) perform
diffusion inversion to extract attention cues from pre-trained image diffusion
models-thereby treating segmentation as an auxiliary process. In this paper, we
propose GS (Generative Segmentation), a novel framework that formulates
segmentation itself as a generative task via label diffusion. Instead of
generating images conditioned on label maps and text, GS reverses the
generative process: it directly generates segmentation masks from noise,
conditioned on both the input image and the accompanying language description.
This paradigm makes label generation the primary modeling target, enabling
end-to-end training with explicit control over spatial and semantic fidelity.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate GS on Panoptic
Narrative Grounding (PNG), a representative and challenging benchmark for
multimodal segmentation that requires panoptic-level reasoning guided by
narrative captions. Experimental results show that GS significantly outperforms
existing discriminative and diffusion-based methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art for language-driven segmentation.

    <title>Symphony: A Decentralized Multi-Agent Framework for Scalable Collective
  Intelligence</title>
    <summary>  Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent frameworks rely on
centralized orchestration, incurring high deployment costs, rigid communication
topologies, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce
Symphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight LLMs on
consumer-grade GPUs to coordinate. Symphony introduces three key mechanisms:
(1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection
protocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on
CoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant
orchestration with low overhead. Empirically, Symphony outperforms existing
baselines on reasoning benchmarks, achieving substantial accuracy gains and
demonstrating robustness across models of varying capacities.

    <title>SWIRL: A Staged Workflow for Interleaved Reinforcement Learning in
  Mobile GUI Control</title>
    <summary>  The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent
systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably
translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent
approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although
multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress
in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by
inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To
address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved
reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates
MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one
agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable
training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we
provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem,
and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled
optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a
Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and
an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and
low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong
capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as
a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.

    <title>HPC Digital Twins for Evaluating Scheduling Policies, Incentive
  Structures and their Impact on Power and Cooling</title>
    <summary>  Schedulers are critical for optimal resource utilization in high-performance
computing. Traditional methods to evaluate schedulers are limited to
post-deployment analysis, or simulators, which do not model associated
infrastructure. In this work, we present the first-of-its-kind integration of
scheduling and digital twins in HPC. This enables what-if studies to understand
the impact of parameter configurations and scheduling decisions on the physical
assets, even before deployment, or regarching changes not easily realizable in
production. We (1) provide the first digital twin framework extended with
scheduling capabilities, (2) integrate various top-tier HPC systems given their
publicly available datasets, (3) implement extensions to integrate external
scheduling simulators. Finally, we show how to (4) implement and evaluate
incentive structures, as-well-as (5) evaluate machine learning based
scheduling, in such novel digital-twin based meta-framework to prototype
scheduling. Our work enables what-if scenarios of HPC systems to evaluate
sustainability, and the impact on the simulated system.

    <title>Decomposing Behavioral Phase Transitions in LLMs: Order Parameters for
  Emergent Misalignment</title>
    <summary>  Fine-tuning LLMs on narrowly harmful datasets can lead to behavior that is
broadly misaligned with respect to human values. To understand when and how
this emergent misalignment occurs, we develop a comprehensive framework for
detecting and characterizing rapid transitions during fine-tuning using both
distributional change detection methods as well as order parameters that are
formulated in plain English and evaluated by an LLM judge. Using an objective
statistical dissimilarity measure, we quantify how the phase transition that
occurs during fine-tuning affects multiple aspects of the model. In particular,
we assess what percentage of the total distributional change in model outputs
is captured by different aspects, such as alignment or verbosity, providing a
decomposition of the overall transition. We also find that the actual
behavioral transition occurs later in training than indicated by the peak in
the gradient norm alone. Our framework enables the automated discovery and
quantification of language-based order parameters, which we demonstrate on
examples ranging from knowledge questions to politics and ethics.

    <title>CataractSurg-80K: Knowledge-Driven Benchmarking for Structured Reasoning
  in Ophthalmic Surgery Planning</title>
    <summary>  Cataract surgery remains one of the most widely performed and effective
procedures for vision restoration. Effective surgical planning requires
integrating diverse clinical examinations for patient assessment, intraocular
lens (IOL) selection, and risk evaluation. Large language models (LLMs) have
shown promise in supporting clinical decision-making. However, existing LLMs
often lack the domain-specific expertise to interpret heterogeneous ophthalmic
data and provide actionable surgical plans. To enhance the model's ability to
interpret heterogeneous ophthalmic reports, we propose a knowledge-driven
Multi-Agent System (MAS), where each agent simulates the reasoning process of
specialist ophthalmologists, converting raw clinical inputs into structured,
actionable summaries in both training and deployment stages. Building on MAS,
we introduce CataractSurg-80K, the first large-scale benchmark for cataract
surgery planning that incorporates structured clinical reasoning. Each case is
annotated with diagnostic questions, expert reasoning chains, and structured
surgical recommendations. We further introduce Qwen-CSP, a domain-specialized
model built on Qwen-4B, fine-tuned through a multi-stage process tailored for
surgical planning. Comprehensive experiments show that Qwen-CSP outperforms
strong general-purpose LLMs across multiple metrics. Our work delivers a
high-quality dataset, a rigorous benchmark, and a domain-adapted LLM to
facilitate future research in medical AI reasoning and decision support.

    <title>Cross-Platform E-Commerce Product Categorization and Recategorization: A
  Multimodal Hierarchical Classification Approach</title>
    <summary>  This study addresses critical industrial challenges in e-commerce product
categorization, namely platform heterogeneity and the structural limitations of
existing taxonomies, by developing and deploying a multimodal hierarchical
classification framework. Using a dataset of 271,700 products from 40
international fashion e-commerce platforms, we integrate textual features
(RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision--language representations
(CLIP). We investigate fusion strategies, including early, late, and
attention-based fusion within a hierarchical architecture enhanced by dynamic
masking to ensure taxonomic consistency. Results show that CLIP embeddings
combined via an MLP-based late-fusion strategy achieve the highest hierarchical
F1 (98.59\%), outperforming unimodal baselines. To address shallow or
inconsistent categories, we further introduce a self-supervised ``product
recategorization'' pipeline using SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering, which
discovered new, fine-grained categories (e.g., subtypes of ``Shoes'') with
cluster purities above 86\%. Cross-platform experiments reveal a
deployment-relevant trade-off: complex late-fusion methods maximize accuracy
with diverse training data, while simpler early-fusion methods generalize more
effectively to unseen platforms. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's
industrial scalability through deployment in EURWEB's commercial transaction
intelligence platform via a two-stage inference pipeline, combining a
lightweight RoBERTa stage with a GPU--accelerated multimodal stage to balance
cost and accuracy.

    <title>Linear-Time Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Gradient
  Estimation</title>
    <summary>  This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for
in-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we
quickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream
inference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context
learning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of
token embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the
output taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs
through a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this
estimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the
sampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and
select $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing
model outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative
to model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models
and datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient
estimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than
$\mathbf{1}\%$ error across six datasets. This allows us to scale up subset
selection that would otherwise run full inference by up to
$\mathbf{37.7}\times$ on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, and
outperform existing selection methods based on input embeddings by
$\mathbf{11}\%$ on average.

    <summary>  Legal text classification is a fundamental NLP task in the legal domain.
Benchmark datasets in this area often exhibit a long-tail label distribution,
where many labels are underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on
rare classes. This paper proposes Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) as a
solution to this problem. SRA focuses on augmenting samples belonging to
low-frequency labels in the training set, preventing the introduction of noise
for well-represented classes, and requires no changes to the model
architecture. Retrieval is performed only from the training data to ensure
there is no potential information leakage, removing the need for external
corpora simultaneously. The proposed SRA method is tested on two legal text
classification benchmark datasets with long-tail distributions: LEDGAR
(single-label) and UNFAIR-ToS (multi-label). The results indicate that SRA
attains higher micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores compared to all current LexGLUE
baselines across both datasets, illustrating consistent improvements in
long-tail legal text classification. The code repository is available at:

    <title>ReSURE: Regularizing Supervision Unreliability for Multi-turn Dialogue
  Fine-tuning</title>
    <summary>  Fine-tuning multi-turn dialogue systems requires high-quality supervision but
often suffers from degraded performance when exposed to low-quality data.
Supervision errors in early turns can propagate across subsequent turns,
undermining coherence and response quality. Existing methods typically address
data quality via static prefiltering, which decouples quality control from
training and fails to mitigate turn-level error propagation. In this context,
we propose ReSURE (Regularizing Supervision UnREliability), an adaptive
learning method that dynamically down-weights unreliable supervision without
explicit filtering. ReSURE estimates per-turn loss distributions using
Welford's online statistics and reweights sample losses on the fly accordingly.
Experiments on both single-source and mixed-quality datasets show improved
stability and response quality. Notably, ReSURE enjoys positive Spearman
correlations (0.21 ~ 1.0 across multiple benchmarks) between response scores
and number of samples regardless of data quality, which potentially paves the
way for utilizing large-scale data effectively. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/ReSURE_Multi_Turn_Training.

    <title>The Coherent Multiplex: Scalable Real-Time Wavelet Coherence
  Architecture</title>
    <summary>  The Coherent Multiplex is formalized and validated as a scalable, real-time
system for identifying, analyzing, and visualizing coherence among multiple
time series. Its architecture comprises a fast spectral similarity layer based
on cosine similarity metrics of Fourier-transformed signals, and a sparse
time-frequency layer for wavelet coherence. The system constructs and evolves a
multilayer graph representing inter-signal relationships, enabling low-latency
inference and monitoring. A simulation prototype demonstrates functionality
across 8 synthetic channels with a high similarity threshold for further
computation, with additional opportunities for scaling the architecture up to
support thousands of input signals with constrained hardware. Applications
discussed include neuroscience, finance, and biomedical signal analysis.

    <title>MathBuddy: A Multimodal System for Affective Math Tutoring</title>
    <summary>  The rapid adoption of LLM-based conversational systems is already
transforming the landscape of educational technology. However, the current
state-of-the-art learning models do not take into account the student's
affective states. Multiple studies in educational psychology support the claim
that positive or negative emotional states can impact a student's learning
capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present MathBuddy, an emotionally aware
LLM-powered Math Tutor, which dynamically models the student's emotions and
maps them to relevant pedagogical strategies, making the tutor-student
conversation a more empathetic one. The student's emotions are captured from
the conversational text as well as from their facial expressions. The student's
emotions are aggregated from both modalities to confidently prompt our LLM
Tutor for an emotionally-aware response. We have effectively evaluated our
model using automatic evaluation metrics across eight pedagogical dimensions
and user studies. We report a massive 23 point performance gain using the win
rate and a 3 point gain at an overall level using DAMR scores which strongly
supports our hypothesis of improving LLM-based tutor's pedagogical abilities by
modeling students' emotions.

    <title>Self-Supervised Pre-Training with Equilibrium Constraints</title>
    <summary>  Self-supervised pre-training using unlabeled data is widely used in machine
learning. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach
to dealing with heterogeneous data. Instead of mixing all the data and
minimizing the averaged global loss in the conventional way, we impose
additional equilibrium constraints to ensure that the models optimizes each
source of heterogeneous data to its local optima after $K$-step gradient
descent initialized from the model. We formulate this as a bilevel optimization
problem, and use the first-order approximation method to solve the problem. We
discuss its connection to model-agnostic meta learning (MAML). Experiments are
carried out on self-supervised pre-training using multi-domain and multilingual
datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach can significantly improve
the adaptivity of the self-supervised pre-trained model for the downstream
supervised fine-tuning tasks.

    <title>AgentCoMa: A Compositional Benchmark Mixing Commonsense and Mathematical
  Reasoning in Real-World Scenarios</title>
    <summary>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved high accuracy on complex
commonsense and mathematical problems that involve the composition of multiple
reasoning steps. However, current compositional benchmarks testing these skills
tend to focus on either commonsense or math reasoning, whereas LLM agents
solving real-world tasks would require a combination of both. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each
compositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning
step. We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training
strategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet
their accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined. This is a
substantially greater performance gap than the one we observe in prior
compositional benchmarks that combine multiple steps of the same reasoning
type. In contrast, non-expert human annotators can solve the compositional
questions and the individual steps in AgentCoMa with similarly high accuracy.
Furthermore, we conduct a series of interpretability studies to better
understand the performance gap, examining neuron patterns, attention maps and
membership inference. Our work underscores a substantial degree of model
brittleness in the context of mixed-type compositional reasoning and offers a
test bed for future improvement.

    <title>Diffusion Language Models Know the Answer Before Decoding</title>
    <summary>  Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to
autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible
token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of
autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and
the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this
work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer
convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by
half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and
random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%
of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the
refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a
training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.
Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to
go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the
confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It
integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible
overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of
LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the
number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation
quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop
sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet
powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing
speedup techniques. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/pixeli99/Prophet.

    <title>Evaluating Language Model Reasoning about Confidential Information</title>
    <summary>  As language models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in
high-stakes settings, ensuring that they reliably follow user-defined rules has
become a critical safety concern. To this end, we study whether language models
exhibit contextual robustness, or the capability to adhere to context-dependent
safety specifications. For this analysis, we develop a benchmark (PasswordEval)
that measures whether language models can correctly determine when a user
request is authorized (i.e., with a correct password). We find that current
open- and closed-source models struggle with this seemingly simple task, and
that, perhaps surprisingly, reasoning capabilities do not generally improve
performance. In fact, we find that reasoning traces frequently leak
confidential information, which calls into question whether reasoning traces
should be exposed to users in such applications. We also scale the difficulty
of our evaluation along multiple axes: (i) by adding adversarial user pressure
through various jailbreaking strategies, and (ii) through longer multi-turn
conversations where password verification is more challenging. Overall, our
results suggest that current frontier models are not well-suited to handling
confidential information, and that reasoning capabilities may need to be
trained in a different manner to make them safer for release in high-stakes
settings.

    <title>Reducing Street Parking Search Time via Smart Assignment Strategies</title>
    <summary>  In dense metropolitan areas, searching for street parking adds to traffic
congestion. Like many other problems, real-time assistants based on mobile
phones have been proposed, but their effectiveness is understudied. This work
quantifies how varying levels of user coordination and information availability
through such apps impact search time and the probability of finding street
parking. Through a data-driven simulation of Madrid's street parking ecosystem,
we analyze four distinct strategies: uncoordinated search (Unc-Agn),
coordinated parking without awareness of non-users (Cord-Agn), an idealized
oracle system that knows the positions of all non-users (Cord-Oracle), and our
novel/practical Cord-Approx strategy that estimates non-users' behavior
probabilistically. The Cord-Approx strategy, instead of requiring knowledge of
how close non-users are to a certain spot in order to decide whether to
navigate toward it, uses past occupancy distributions to elongate physical
distances between system users and alternative parking spots, and then solves a
Hungarian matching problem to dispatch accordingly. In high-fidelity
simulations of Madrid's parking network with real traffic data, users of
Cord-Approx averaged 6.69 minutes to find parking, compared to 19.98 minutes
for non-users without an app. A zone-level snapshot shows that Cord-Approx
reduces search time for system users by 72% (range = 67-76%) in central hubs,
and up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users.

    <title>Short-Horizon Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Pumps Using
  Time-Series Features and Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  This study presents a machine learning framework for forecasting short-term
faults in industrial centrifugal pumps using real-time sensor data. The
approach aims to predict {EarlyWarning} conditions 5, 15, and 30 minutes in
advance based on patterns extracted from historical operation. Two lookback
periods, 60 minutes and 120 minutes, were evaluated using a sliding window
approach. For each window, statistical features including mean, standard
deviation, minimum, maximum, and linear trend were extracted, and class
imbalance was addressed using the SMOTE algorithm. Random Forest and XGBoost
classifiers were trained and tested on the labeled dataset. Results show that
the Random Forest model achieved the best short-term forecasting performance
with a 60-minute window, reaching recall scores of 69.2\% at 5 minutes, 64.9\%
at 15 minutes, and 48.6\% at 30 minutes. With a 120-minute window, the Random
Forest model achieved 57.6\% recall at 5 minutes, and improved predictive
accuracy of 65.6\% at both 15 and 30 minutes. XGBoost displayed similar but
slightly lower performance. These findings highlight that optimal history
length depends on the prediction horizon, and that different fault patterns may
evolve at different timescales. The proposed method offers an interpretable and
scalable solution for integrating predictive maintenance into real-time
industrial monitoring systems.

    <title>GLSim: Detecting Object Hallucinations in LVLMs via Global-Local
  Similarity</title>
    <summary>  Object hallucination in large vision-language models presents a significant
challenge to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent works
have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of
object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or
local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this
paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection
framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity
signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable
hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark
existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim
achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by
a significant margin.

    <title>Assessing the Geolocation Capabilities, Limitations and Societal Risks
  of Generative Vision-Language Models</title>
    <summary>  Geo-localization is the task of identifying the location of an image using
visual cues alone. It has beneficial applications, such as improving disaster
response, enhancing navigation, and geography education. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly demonstrating capabilities as
accurate image geo-locators. This brings significant privacy risks, including
those related to stalking and surveillance, considering the widespread uses of
AI models and sharing of photos on social media. The precision of these models
is likely to improve in the future. Despite these risks, there is little work
on systematically evaluating the geolocation precision of Generative VLMs,
their limits and potential for unintended inferences. To bridge this gap, we
conduct a comprehensive assessment of the geolocation capabilities of 25
state-of-the-art VLMs on four benchmark image datasets captured in diverse
environments. Our results offer insight into the internal reasoning of VLMs and
highlight their strengths, limitations, and potential societal risks. Our
findings indicate that current VLMs perform poorly on generic street-level
images yet achieve notably high accuracy (61\%) on images resembling social
media content, raising significant and urgent privacy concerns.
